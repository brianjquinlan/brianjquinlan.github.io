                    <p> 
                        My name is Brian Quinlan and I am recently graduated from Lewis University
                        with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.  I was originally only a 
                        math major but after taking my required computer science course I immediately
                        knew programming was my future.

                    <h1> Coding </h1>
                    <p> I am most comfortable coding in Python and am fairly familiar with Java, and 
                        PHP.  I have done projects with all of these languages most recently using 
                        Python to create a website using Django.  I used Java in android development
                        and PHP for my senior project with a team of other students.  In the process
                        of these projects I have also become familiar with html, css, and javascript
                        as well.

                    <h1> About Myself </h1>
                    <p> Besides Programming I enjoy playing playing piano as well as golf.  I have
                        lately been very interested in blues styled piano which has a very interesting
                        sound to it and allows for fun improvisation.  My Dad started me out young
                        at golf and although during highschool I lost interest in it I have picked it
                        back up lately.  As frustating as it may be you always want to get back out 
                        there.

                    <h1><a name="project-1">Rec Sports Stats </a></h1>
                    <p> This project was something I decided to work on 
                        because I wanted to try and get familiar with a web 
                        framework. Because I am a big fan of Python I thought 
                        Django would be a great framework for me to learn.  
                    </p>
                    <h4> Structure </h4>
                    <p> The rec sports stats website is a site where users
                        can sign up and create leagues, teams, and then games
                        to keep track of the stats they accumulate.  It is 
                        for baseball rec leagues so the gameform includes stats
                        like homeruns, strikeouts, batting avergage, ect. These
                        stats are taken and put into graphs and aggregated based
                        on the league or individual team.
